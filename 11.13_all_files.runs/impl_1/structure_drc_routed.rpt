PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net signal_process1/unit0/cd_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin signal_process1/unit0/cd_reg/L3_2/O, cell signal_process1/unit0/cd_reg/L3_2 (in signal_process1/unit0/cd_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
